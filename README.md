# Meteors-THREEjs
Three js game inspired by Will Whiteneck. (will think of a better name :wink: )

## PLEASE NOTE
- This game has been developed using the http-server node js module with all default settings.
- All resource file paths from `Resources/main.js` start from the root directory of `index.html`.
- The "Play" button is the only button that works in the menu.
### How to setup 
1. [Install node.js](https://nodejs.org)
2. Open your command prompt and type `npm install http-server -g`
3. Use command prompt to navigate to the cloned repository
4. Type `http-server -o` and click on `index.htm`
### How to play
Use WASD keys to navigate in a 2D plane. Avoid meteors and collect the red points. Blue points are bonus items which adds extra to your score and slows down incoming meteors. The more points you collect, the faster the meteors will become.

#### Update
